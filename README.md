## For developers

Project is based on `AngularJS 1.5`

You need to create an app on https://developer.spotify.com/ and get `clientId`. You must also add `http://localhost:<PORT>/afterLogin` to the urls whitelist.

Spotify API requires HTTPS for authentication so for local development generate self signed cert and put it in `certs` dir. For `CN` provide `localhost`

```bash
cd certs
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout localhost.key -out localhost.crt
```

**How to run**
- optionally change port in `package.json` in `start` command
- set clientId in `config.dev.json`
- `npm install`
- `npm start`
- Navigate to `https://127.0.0.1:<PORT>`
